                    <p>The Bogside Artists® are the sole creators of the world famous People's Gallery® in the Bogside area of Derry in the North of Ireland. The twelve large scale murals are a main visitor attraction in the city. For the artists themselves they are socialist in essence and transcend all sectarian and ideological conflicts that have afflicted the province since 1968. They are a human document.</p>
